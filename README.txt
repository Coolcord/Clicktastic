-===========================- About Clicktastic -===========================-

Clicktastic is an autoclicker that I designed for fun. The goal of this 
project was to make an autoclicker that provided more options and allowed
for much customization compared to what's currently available.

Like usual for me when I design an application, I look around and try to see
what's available. With autoclickers, I couldn't find any that were up to my
liking. Consequently, this project started.

Most autoclickers I found were rather slow, in my opinion, and I was determined
that I could make one that was faster. This is where the turbo option comes 
into play. Normally the application will request a click every 1 millisecond.
However, with turbo, this can be multiplied, allowing for more clicks at each
request. This speeds up the autoclicking process significantly.

However, turbo mode may not work on every machine. If you experience any kind
of lag, whether it'd be input lag, mouse lag, or lag within the application 
that you are autoclicking, it may be a good idea to turn the turbo mode down.
Ludicrous speed can be very taxing, even for very high end machines. This is 
mostly a limitation of the current operating systems available, due to the
way that they handle taking input via message input queues.

Another problem most autoclickers have is that their speed is constant -- too
constant. This is part of the reason why autoclickers can often be detected.
A human can't press a button with that precise of timing for that long.
Random speed mode solves this by allowing the user to input a minimum and 
maximum delay time, allowing the autoclicker to appear more human like.

I decided to take the autoclicker a step further and add sounds. This enhances
the autoclicking experience much more. By default, the sounds only play when
max turbo (Ludicrous speed) is enabled, but they can be turned to always on or
muted.

By making this application open source, I hope to make it easier for others
to build an autoclicker that meets their own personal needs, using this
source code as a base.
